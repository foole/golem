# golem
Golem takes in a YAML file and creates a VM based on that YAML (including installing the OS on the VM).

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem): "The existence of a golem is sometimes a mixed
blessing. Golems are not intelligent, and if commanded to perform a task, they will perform the
instructions literally. In many depictions Golems are inherently perfectly obedient."
